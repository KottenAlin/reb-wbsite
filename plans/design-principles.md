# Design Principles

## Core Philosophy: Minimalist Utility

The design should prioritize functionality and clarity above all else. Avoid unnecessary ornamentation that does not contribute to the user's understanding or interaction with the game.

## 1. Minimalist Design Principles

- **Functional Hierarchy**: Elements should be arranged by importance. Use size, weight, and spacing to guide the user's eye.
- **Generous Whitespace**: Do not crowd the interface. Clear space helps the user focus on the core gameplay loop.
- **Limited Color Palette**: Use a consistent, restrained set of colors. High contrast should be reserved for interactive elements and critical feedback.
- **Clear Typography**: Prioritize readability. Use standard system fonts or clean sans-serif typefaces.
- **Consistency**: UI components (buttons, cards, headers) must look and behave predictably across the entire application.

## 2. Minimalist Emoji Policy

To maintain a professional and clean aesthetic, emoji usage is strictly regulated:

- **Functional Only**: Emojis should only be used as functional icons (e.g., in a shop list) where they provide immediate visual identification.
- **No Decoration**: Never use emojis for purely decorative purposes or to fill empty space.
- **Single Instance**: Avoid using multiple emojis in a row.
- **Contextual Relevance**: Only use emojis that directly represent the item or concept they are associated with.

## 3. User Experience Priorities

- **Immediate Feedback**: Actions (like clicking or purchasing) should have instant, clear visual or numerical feedback.
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Information should be bite-sized. Do not overwhelm the player with too many stats at once.
- **Ease of Navigation**: The transition between game sections or menus should be seamless and intuitive.
